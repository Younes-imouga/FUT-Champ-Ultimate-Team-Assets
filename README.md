Hello this is My 7th Brief In Youcode : FUT-Champ-Ultimate-Team :

Design an Ultimate Team team management web application for EA FC 25, allowing users to create, customize and manage their tactical formations and player squads through an interactive interface.

The app will allow users to build their FUT (Ultimate Team) squad by adding, positioning, and modifying players while respecting tactical formations like 4-4-2 or 4-3-3. The focus will 
be on an interactive experience with dynamic forms, data management via localStorage, and an interactive interface

The user can click on the add button to see the form then he can fill all the input (obligatoire) to get a new player in his players container

he then can drag him and drop him in a position of his choice

the user can clikc on the edit button enabling the edit mode he can then click a player to display his data in the form then edit it

the same goes for the delete once you click remove button the delete mode activate and you click a player to get his name with a confirmation button

the user can change the position of the players in the field then change the player's positions by a drag/drop
